	Use a dictionary to keep track of functions instead of lists.

	This means that we no longer have to look through the list of symbols
	so much, and thus can be very fast. libxul takes 17s (!) now!

	* dict.h: Add a dictionary header.
	* dict.c: Add a basic dictionary implementation.
	* unused.c: Use a dictionary instead of arrays to store symbols.
	* meson.build: Build dict.c.

	Use a custom function to replace fprintf unless we're in debug mode.

	fake_fprintf() avoids running fprintf, and it is a lot faster! I found
	before I could run this on libxul.so as a test, and it not once
	started printing anything out. Now? Thirty seconds or so and we're
	printing. Incredible.

	* unused.c: Use a custom function to replace fprintf.

	Allows compilation with C++. This isn't very well supported by Meson
	at this point, but it does mean that we meet higher type-safety
	standards. I mean, we cast everything, but oh well.

	* unused.c: Allow compilation with C++ by adding casts on
	reallocarray.

	Fixes the debug FILE* not having correct permissions, or a potential
	segfault if /dev/null can't be opened for some reason.

	* unused.c: Fix the debug stream's permissions and error handling.

	Fixes some memory leaks in unused.c.

	* unused.c: Fix some memory leaks.

	Migrate to ANSI C. Why? Why not?

	One inspiration for this was the Hundred Rabbits <https://100r.co>,
	who have written plenty of utilities in ANSI C.

	It's surprisingly not that bad, but I don't know why I do this to
	myself.

	* unused.c: Get rid of sanity.
	* unused.c: Define _DEFAULT_SOURCE and _POSIX_C_SOURCE to get access
	to various functions that aren't available in C89 by default.
	* meson.build: Use c89 as the default C standard version.

	This adds disassembly so then we can actually see what symbols are
	actually being used. Frankly, it's surprisingly close to done at this
	point! :D

	* unused.c: Use libopcodes to do disassembly.
	* meson.build: Add libopcodes as a dependency.

2021-03-18  thatlittlegit  <personal@thatlittlegit.tk>

	* .clang-format: Add basic clang-format file with some alright formatting.
	* meson.build: Add initial Meson build file.
	* unused.c: Add basic C skeleton that prints all the functions in a file.
