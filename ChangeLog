	This adds disassembly so then we can actually see what symbols are
	actually being used. Frankly, it's surprisingly close to done at this

	* unused.c: Use libopcodes to do disassembly.
	* meson.build: Add libopcodes as a dependency.

	* .clang-format: Add basic clang-format file with some alright formatting.
	* meson.build: Add initial Meson build file.
	* unused.c: Add basic C skeleton that prints all the functions in a file.
