	Migrate to ANSI C. Why? Why not?

	One inspiration for this was the Hundred Rabbits <https://100r.co>,
	who have written plenty of utilities in ANSI C.

	It's surprisingly not that bad, but I don't know why I do this to
	myself.

	* unused.c: Get rid of sanity.
	* unused.c: Define _DEFAULT_SOURCE and _POSIX_C_SOURCE to get access
	to various functions that aren't available in C89 by default.
	* meson.build: Use c89 as the default C standard version.

	This adds disassembly so then we can actually see what symbols are
	actually being used. Frankly, it's surprisingly close to done at this
	point! :D

	* unused.c: Use libopcodes to do disassembly.
	* meson.build: Add libopcodes as a dependency.

	* .clang-format: Add basic clang-format file with some alright formatting.
	* meson.build: Add initial Meson build file.
	* unused.c: Add basic C skeleton that prints all the functions in a file.
